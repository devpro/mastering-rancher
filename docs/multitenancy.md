# Multitenancy

## Solutions for Kubernetes

> Multi-tenancy is a Kubernetes cluster model or architecture model in which a single cluster’s resources are shared among multiple tenants. Examples of the shared cluster resources include CPU, memory, networking, and control plane resources. ([ContainIQ](https://www.containiq.com/post/kubernetes-multi-tenancy))

### Kubeslice

> KubeSlice enables Kubernetes pods and services to communicate seamlessly across clusters, clouds, edges, and data centers by creating logical application boundaries known as Slices. It combines network, application, and deployment services in a framework to accelerate application deployment in a multi-cluster, multi-tenant environment.

### vcluster (by Loft Labs)

> Virtual Kubernetes Clusters that run inside regular namespaces

### VirtualCLuster

> VirtualCluster represents a new architecture to address various Kubernetes control plane isolation challenges. It extends existing namespace based Kubernetes multi-tenancy model by providing each tenant a cluster view. VirtualCluster completely leverages Kubernetes extendability and preserves full API compatibility. That being said, the core Kubernetes components are not modified in virtual cluster.
